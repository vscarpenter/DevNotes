# Memory Management in DevNotes

## Overview

DevNotes includes built-in memory management to ensure optimal performance and stability, especially when working with large documents or extensive user guides. This document explains how memory management works in DevNotes and what to do if you encounter memory-related issues.

## Automatic Memory Management

DevNotes implements several automatic memory management strategies:

### Periodic Cleanup

The application automatically performs periodic memory cleanup to prevent excessive memory usage:

- Regular cleanup occurs every 15-30 seconds in memory-intensive components
- Cache entries are pruned when they exceed configured thresholds
- Unused resources are released when no longer needed

### Memory Usage Monitoring

DevNotes actively monitors memory usage and takes action when memory pressure is detected:

```javascript
// Example of memory monitoring (internal implementation)
if (MemoryManager.isMemoryUsageHigh()) {
  // Perform aggressive cleanup
  MemoryManager.clearAllCaches();
  LazyContentLoader.cancelLoading();
}
```

### Lazy Loading

Content is loaded on-demand to minimize memory usage:

- Only the current section and adjacent sections are loaded
- Images and other resources are loaded only when scrolled into view
- Content is unloaded when no longer visible

## Memory Warning Indicators

If DevNotes detects high memory usage, you may see a memory warning banner:

![Memory Warning](../assets/memory-warning.png)

This warning indicates that the application is performing cleanup to prevent performance issues or crashes. You can dismiss this warning, but it's recommended to:

1. Save any unsaved work
2. Consider closing and reopening the application if performance degrades
3. Reduce the number of open documents or sections

## Troubleshooting Memory Issues

If you experience performance degradation or crashes related to memory:

### Immediate Actions

1. **Save your work**: Always save your work frequently
2. **Restart the application**: Close and reopen DevNotes
3. **Clear browser cache**: If using the web version, clear your browser cache

### Preventive Measures

1. **Limit large documents**: Break very large documents into smaller ones
2. **Close unused sections**: Don't keep too many sections open simultaneously
3. **Optimize images**: Use compressed images in your notes
4. **Update regularly**: Ensure you're using the latest version with memory optimizations

## Advanced Memory Management

For advanced users, DevNotes provides some configurable memory management options:

### Local Storage Cleanup

To manually clear cached data:

1. Go to Settings > Advanced
2. Click "Clear Application Cache"
3. Restart the application

### Browser Console Commands

In the browser console (Developer Tools), you can run:

```javascript
// Clear all caches
devnotes.MemoryManager.clearAllCaches();

// Get current memory usage
devnotes.MemoryManager.getMemoryUsage();
```

## Technical Details

DevNotes implements several technical strategies for memory management:

1. **Content virtualization**: Only renders visible content
2. **Weak references**: Uses WeakMap and WeakSet for temporary references
3. **Cache size limits**: Restricts the number of cached items
4. **Garbage collection hints**: Suggests garbage collection when appropriate
5. **Resource cleanup**: Properly disposes of resources when components unmount

## Reporting Memory Issues

If you encounter persistent memory issues:

1. Note the steps that led to the issue
2. Check the console for error messages (Developer Tools > Console)
3. Report the issue through Help > Report Issue, including:
   - Browser/OS version
   - Actions performed before the issue
   - Any error messages
   - Memory usage information if available
